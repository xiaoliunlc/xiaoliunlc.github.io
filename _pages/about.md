I am Ph.D. candidate with [School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology](http://cs.bit.edu.cn/).

My research interests are mainly focused on Natural Language Processing (especially Event Extraction and Event Schema Induction) with machine learning approaches.

My Ph.D. supervisor is [Prof. Heyan Huang](http://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/js/hhy/index.htm).


<!-- Here is my latest [CV](/assets/pdf/xiaoliu-CV.pdf). -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
