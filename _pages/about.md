My name is Xiao LIU (刘啸 in Chinese).
I am a researcher in the [Natural Language Computing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/natural-language-computing/) group at [MSRA](https://www.msra.cn/).
I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [BIT](http://www.bit.edu.cn/) in June 2022, under the supervision of Prof. [Heyan Huang](http://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/js/hhy/index.htm).
My doctoral thesis is about event extraction and was awarded the excellent Ph.D. thesis of Beijing Institute of Technology.
My current research interests include **generation**, **retrieval** and **extraction**.
You can find me in [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xiaoliu2/).
