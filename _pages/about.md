My name is Xiao LIU (刘啸 in Chinese).
I am a researcher in the Natural Language Computing (NLC) group at [MSRA](https://www.msra.cn/).
I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the [School of Computer Science, BIT](http://cs.bit.edu.cn/) in June 2022, under the supervision of Prof. [Heyan Huang](http://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/js/hhy/index.htm).
My doctoral thesis is about event extraction and was awarded *the excellent Ph.D. thesis of Beijing Institute of Technology*.
Before joining MSRA, I’ve also spent time at [Netease Youdao](http://www.youdao.com/) (2016), [MSRA](https://www.msra.cn/) (2017) and [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/) (2022).

My current research interests include **natural language processing**, **information retrieval (dense + sparse)** and **information extraction**.
You can find me in [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xiaoliu2/).
